Markup Wireframes with CSS


Website developed as a team for the Web Development Module of University of London's Computer Science BSc

Markup wireframes with Appearance CSS
Review the three wireframes that you produced for the large screen version of your web site from part 1 of the team project and add to them to ensure that they have the appearance that you wish your site to have. Ensure that you have agreed the colours that will be applied to the elements. Agree the font family or specific font that you will use for different parts of your site, and the colours that should be used.
Work through the wireframes and decide on the correct CSS to build those pages, and add classes and identities to the pages. Mark up your wireframes accordingly. Upload a .zip file of these new marked-up versions of the wireframes into the Workspace: static web pages in week 10.
Set up and link stylesheet
Code the CSS stylesheet with these appearance styling instructions and link them to the correct HTML elements using the class and id mechanism.
Upload the pages to the static web page system
Upload your three new versions of HTML pages to the Workspace: static web page system in week 10 with the class and id properties and the CSS stylesheet within a tidy directory structure. Test that everything is working as expected by loading the pages in a browser using the shareable URL for your web site.
Validate the code in the pages
Validate your code using the W3C code validator.

# Review Criteria
Does the URL lead to the correct website?

Applying Appearance Styling: Stylesheets  1pt
Use of a stylesheet to tailor the different styles across the various pages of the website.
Work goes beyond what was taught in the course.

##[LS notes -We use bootstrap, should be a 1pt, goes beyond course]

 
Applying Appearance Styling - Styling Text 1pt
Thoughtful use of text styling to enhance the communication of textual content, including the specification of text alignment. Work goes beyond what was taught in the course.  

Applying Appearance Styling - Font Families 1pt
Wow - I was really impressed by the careful use of font families including calls to external fonts, and it really seemed to enhance the look of the site

##[LS notes - we use external fonts, and it looks clean. maybe can do a little more here, but i think should be sufficient]

Applying Appearance Styling - HTML Object Colouring 1pt
Thoughtful use of color to support the primary user demographic identified for the website.
The use of color is clearly communicting something and enhancing the experience of using the site.

##[LS notes - I've added more (subtle) color definition to the Park Map page, this can be done on other pages by others in the team.
I've also updated the header and links to be a bit bolder with the blue. ]

Applying Appearance Styling - Colour Definition
Thoughtful application of colours, including the use of opacity values with colours.
Work goes beyond what was taught in the course.

##[LS notes - homepage can use a bit more considered opacity on the text over the graphics. I'll leave this to someone else to get busy with]

# To Do

- [] CSS updates (assets/css/bootstrap/scss/style.scss) 
##[This will need to be compiled again to create our final style.css one others have made edits.  might be a good idea to copy what I did and pull out your specific css into a sub file.  just be careful to use your own prefixes so we don't override others css]
